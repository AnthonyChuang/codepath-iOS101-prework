Simple App Idea: Quote a Day
Sends a motivation or insightful quote via notifications every day, and has a place 
to journal your thoughts. Has a clean, simple interface for journaling that is easily
managed by year, month, date, day, time etc. Has a search feature to search for words 
in a specific journal entry. Displays quote on home screen of app.
    

Complex App Idea: Chef Assistant
Uses computer vision to take in a list of groceries, suggests items, gives recipe 
and instructions to make it. The camera would take in the grocery items and with 
machine learning and computer vision, identify the grocery items. There will also
be an input field to input the grocery items. Then, using algorithms, calculate 
different recipes with a given number of items, and the user can choose which to view.
Upon viewing the recipe, the recipe should give detailed items on how to make the dish
using the provided items
